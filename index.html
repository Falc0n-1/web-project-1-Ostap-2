        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Ferrari was founded by Enzo Ferrari, an Italian racing driver and team
          manager, with its roots in motorsport.
          <br />
          After running Scuderia Ferrari as a racing team in the 1930s, Enzo
          produced the first Ferrari car in 1947, the 125 S, featuring a V12
          engine.
          <br />
          Ferrari quickly became successful in Formula 1 and endurance racing,
          using road car sales to fund competition.
          <br />
          Over the decades, the brand became famous for combining high
          performance, elegant Italian design, and exclusivity,
          <br />
          creating legendary models like the 250 GTO, Testarossa, and F40.
          Today, Ferrari remains one of the most iconic luxury car manufacturers
          in the world, closely tied to its racing heritage.

      <!-- Ferrari homeland section  -->
      <section>
        <h2>Ferrari's homeland</h2>
        <p>
          Ferraris homeland is Italy, specifically the region of Emilia-Romagna
          in <mark>northern Italy</mark>, an area famous for engineering, motorsport, and
          food culture.
          <br />
          Ferrari is based in Maranello, a small town near Modena, where Enzo
          Ferrari was born and where the companys headquarters and main factory
          are still located today.
          <br />
          This region is often called “Motor Valley” because it is also home to
          brands like Lamborghini, Maserati, and Ducati.
          <br />
          Emilia-Romagnas strong mechanical tradition, passion for racing, and
          Italian craftsmanship deeply shaped Ferraris identity, design style,
          and racing spirit, making the brand a symbol of Italian excellence
          worldwide.
